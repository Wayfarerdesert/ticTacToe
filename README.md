# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python and Tkinter.

## Description

Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player game where players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid with their designated symbol (usually X or O). The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. If the grid is filled without any player achieving three in a row, the game is considered a draw.
